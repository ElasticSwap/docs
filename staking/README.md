# Staking

{% hint style="info" %}
The individual emissions weight of each contract will be subject to DAO governance and is likely to change as the ElasticSwap product launches and markets mature.
{% endhint %}

Emissions began after deployment of the staking contracts and public Sushi pool. The following public staking pools were deployed with the public market:

$TIC Single Staking (25% of public emissions)

$TIC/$USDC SLP Staking (75% of public emissions)
