# Ampleforth Partnership

We will start with an $AMPL pool at launch of the platform. Given that they founded this space, we can think of no better partnership for day 1. We are also having conversations with several other elastic supply token projects and will be focusing heavily on onboarding these projects once the platform is launched and proven.

Feel free to join the Ampleforth [discord](https://discord.com/invite/mptQ49m) and make yourselves known. Cross-community activity is the primary way you can help to make ElasticSwap a success.

**We are excited about partnerships with any and all protocols that could utilize ElasticSwap, so** [**please get in touch**](https://discord.gg/elasticswap) **with the team if you want to discuss working with us!**
