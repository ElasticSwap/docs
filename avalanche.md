# Avalanche

To bridge assets from another network to Avalanche, we suggest visiting this site that was put together by the team over at Avalanche [https://docs.avax.network/learn/getting-started/#sending-to-other-networks](https://docs.avax.network/learn/getting-started/#sending-to-other-networks)

Setting up the Avalanche network on your Metamask or Frame wallet is very easy. You can add the Avalanche network by visiting [chainlist](https://chainlist.org), connecting your wallet, and adding Avalance Mainnet C-Chain.

If you prefer to interact with native AVAX tokens rather than bridging assets, you can purchase AVAX on most centralized exchanges and transfer them to your wallet. So that you are sure you send them to the correct address, we advise adding Avalanche to your preferred wallet interface before transferring the tokens off exchange.
