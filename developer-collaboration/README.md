# Developer Collaboration

On this page, we want to document our collaboration workflow within the ElasticSwap organization. We are a small, distributed team and don't rely on daily standups or constant meetings; nonetheless, it's crucial to know what fellow teammates are working on and what's next on the priority list.

We use a form of agile project management, though some areas might diverge from its rules. If you want to learn more about agile, follow this link:
