# Project Board

We utilize a GitHub [project board](https://github.com/orgs/ElasticSwap/projects/1) to better visualize our current workload and open issues. Therefore, whenever you create a new issue, make sure to link it to this board.
The board is semi-automated, meaning that issues are moved into the correct columns whenever certain criteria match the conditions.

- **Backlog:** an issue that has been newly opened or re-opened.
- **Done:** an issue that has been closed, either manually or through a PR.

Unfortunately, we can't yet automate the board through GitHub labels, which means that we sometimes have to move issues manually. Remember to move issues into the correct column whenever you change their status, e.g., from _backlog_ to _in progress_, once you start working on them.

The project board bundles issues from the following repositories:

- [elasticswap-sdk](https://github.com/ElasticSwap/elasticswap-sdk)
- [elasticswap-app](https://github.com/ElasticSwap/elasticswap-app)
- [elasticswap-avalanche](https://github.com/ElasticSwap/elasticswap-avalanche)
